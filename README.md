# Builder who Ships 🚀

**Data Scientist with product instincts.** I build ML systems people actually use.

## What I'm Building
- 🎯 **Chrome Extension**: AI context transfer tool (published, daily active users)
- 🔍 **Fraud Detection**: Graph Neural Networks achieving 93% precision 
- 📱 **iOS/Mac App**: Wireless trackpad with 120fps gesture recognition
- 🎬 **ML at Scale**: Recommendation systems processing 25M+ records

## Tech Stack
**ML/AI**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Graph Neural Networks, LangChain  
**Data**: Spark, PySpark, SQL, Pandas, NumPy  
**Cloud**: AWS, GCP, MongoDB, PostgreSQL  
**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Swift, R  

## Philosophy
*"Simple solutions to real pain points win."* 

I optimize for user value over technical complexity. The best code is code that gets out of the way and lets people do what they're trying to do.
